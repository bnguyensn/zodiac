### The Chinese Calendar

The traditional Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar: each month starts on a new moon, and the months are numbered according to solar events, specifically, to guarantee that month 11 always contains the winter solstice.

In order to accomplish this, leap months are inserted in certain years. Leap months are numbered the same as the month they follow. The decision of which month is a leap month depends on the relative movements of the sun and moon.

* **Rule 1** - Calculations are based on the meridian 120deg East

* **Rule 2** - The day on which the new Moon occurs is the first day of the month
